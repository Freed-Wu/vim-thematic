INTRODUCTION                                    *themata* *:themata*

themata lets you quickly find, substitute, and abbreviate several variations
of a word at once.  By default, three case variants (foo, Foo, and FOO) are
operated on by every command.

Two commands are provided.  :themata is the most general interface.
:Subvert provides an alternative, more concise syntax for searching and
substituting.
>
	:themata [options] {abbreviation} {replacement}
	:themata -delete [options] {abbreviation}

	:themata -search [options] {pattern}
	:Subvert/{pattern}[/flags]
	:themata!-search [options] {pattern}
	:Subvert?{pattern}[?flags]

	:themata -search [options] {pattern} {grep-arguments}
	:Subvert /{pattern}/[flags] {grep-options}
	:themata!-search [options] {pattern} {grep-arguments}
	:Subvert!/{pattern}/[flags] {grep-options}

	:[range]themata -substitute [options] {pattern} {replacement}
	:[range]Subvert/{pattern}/{replacement}[/flags]
<
						*:S*
In addition to the :Subvert command, a :S synonym is provided if not
already defined.  This will be used in examples below.

PATTERNS					*themata-patterns*

Patterns can include brace pairs that contain comma separated alternatives:

  box{,es} => box, boxes, Box, Boxes, BOX, BOXES

For commands with a replacement, corresponding brace pairs are used in both
halves.  If the replacement should be identical to the pattern, an empty
brace pair may be used.  If fewer replacements are given than were given in
the pattern, they are looped.  That is, {a,b} on the replacement side is the
same as {a,b,a,b,a,b,...} repeated indefinitely.

The following replaces several different misspellings of "necessary":
>
	:%S/{,un}nec{ce,ces,e}sar{y,ily}/{}nec{es}sar{}/g
<
ABBREVIATING					*themata-abbrev*

By default :themata creates abbreviations, which replace words automatically
as you type.  This is good for words you frequently misspell, or as
shortcuts for longer words.  Since these are just Vim abbreviations, only
whole words will match.
>
	:themata anomol{y,ies} anomal{}
	:themata {,in}consistant{,ly} {}consistent{}
	:themata Tqbf The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
<
Accepts the following options:

 -buffer: buffer local
 -cmdline: work in command line in addition to insert mode

A good place to define abbreviations is "after/plugin/themata.vim",
relative to ~\vimfiles on Windows and ~/.vim everywhere else.

With a bang (:themata!) the abbreviation is also appended to the file in
g:themata_save_file.  The default is "after/plugin/themata.vim", relative
to the install directory.

Abbreviations can be removed with :themata -delete:
>
	themata -delete -buffer -cmdline anomol{y,ies}
<
SEARCHING					*themata-search*

The -search command does a search in a manner similar to / key.
search.  After searching, you can use |n| and |N| as you would with a normal
search.

The following will search for box, Box, and BOX:
>
	:themata -search box
<
When given a single word to operate on, :Subvert defaults to doing a
search as well:
>
	:S/box/
<
This one searches for box, boxes, boxed, boxing, Box, Boxes, Boxed, Boxing,
BOX, BOXES, BOXED, and BOXING:
>
	:S/box{,es,ed,ing}/
<
The following syntaxes search in reverse.
>
	:themata! -search box
	:S?box?
<
Flags can be given with the -flags= option to :themata, or by appending them
after the separator to :Subvert. The flags trigger the following behaviors:

 I: Disable case variations (box, Box, BOX)
 v: Match inside variable names (match my_box, myBox, but not mybox)
 w: Match whole words (like surrounding with \< and \>)

A |search-offset| may follow the flags.
>
	:themata -search -flags=avs+1 box
	:S?box{,es,ed,ing}?we
<
GREPPING					*themata-grep*

Grepping works similar to searching, and is invoked when additional options
are given.  These options are passed directly to the :grep command.
>
	:themata -search box{,es}
	:S /box{,es}/ *
	:S /box/aw *.txt *.html
<
The slash delimiters must both be present if used with :Subvert.  They may
both be omitted if no flags are used.

Both an external grepprg and vimgrep (via grepprg=internal) are supported.
With an external grep, the "v" flag behaves less intelligently, due to the
lack of look ahead and look behind support in grep regexps.

SUBSTITUTING					*themata-substitute*

Giving a range switches :Subvert into substitute mode.  This command will
change box -> bag, boxes -> bags, Box -> Bag, Boxes -> Bags, BOX -> BAG,
BOXES -> BAGS across the entire document:
>
	:%themata -substitute -flags=g box{,es} bag{,s}
	:%S/box{,es}/bag{,s}/g
<
The "c", "e", "g", and "n" flags can be used from the substitute command
|:s_flags|, along with the "a", "I", "v", and "w" flags from searching.

COERCION					*themata-coercion* *cr*

themata's case mutating algorithms can be applied to the word under the cursor
using the cr mapping (mnemonic: CoeRce) followed by one of the following
characters:

  c: camelCase
  m: MixedCase
  _: snake_case
  s: snake_case
  u: SNAKE_UPPERCASE
  U: SNAKE_UPPERCASE
  -: dash-case (not reversible)

For example, cru on a lowercase word is a slightly easier to type equivalent
to gUiw.
